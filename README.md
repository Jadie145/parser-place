Welcome to **Parser Place**, a simple HTML-based tool designed for educational purposes in compiler design. This project provides various parser implementations and visualizations to help users understand the concepts of parsing in programming languages.

## Features
- <img src="logos/LL1.png" alt="LL(1) Logo" height="20"/> **LL(1) Parser**: Generate LL(1) parsing tables and visualize the parsing process.
- <img src="logos/LR0.png" alt="LR(0) Logo" height="20"/> **LR(0) Parser**: Visualize and generate LR(0) parsing tables.
- <img src="logos/SLR1.png" alt="SLR(1) Logo" height="20"/> **SLR(1) Parser**: Explore SLR(1) parsing techniques and their applications.
- <img src="logos/LR1.png" alt="LR(1) Logo" height="20"/> **LR(1) Parser**: Visualize and generate LR(1) parsing tables.
- <img src="logos/LALR.png" alt="LALR Logo" height="20"/> **LALR Parser**: Explore LALR parsing techniques and their applications.
