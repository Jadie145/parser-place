# ![Parser Place Logo](logos/logo.png)Parser Place

Welcome to **Parser Place**, a simple HTML-based tool designed for educational purposes in compiler design. This project provides various parser implementations and visualizations to help users understand the concepts of parsing in programming languages.

## Features
- ![LL(1) Logo](logos/LL1.png) **LL(1) Parser**: Generate LL(1) parsing tables and visualize the parsing process.
- ![LR(0) Logo](logos/LR0.png) **LR(0) Parser**: Visualize and generate LR(0) parsing tables.
- ![SLR(1) Logo](logos/SLR1.png) **SLR(1) Parser**: Explore SLR(1) parsing techniques and their applications.
- ![LR(1) Logo](logos/LR1.png) **LR(1) Parser**: Visualize and generate LR(1) parsing tables.
- ![LALR Logo](logos/LALR.png) **LALR Parser**: Explore LALR parsing techniques and their applications.
- ![Operator Precedence Logo](logos/OPR.png) **Operator Precedence Parser**: Understand operator precedence and its role in parsing expressions.
